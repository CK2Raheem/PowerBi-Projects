Hello all NFL fans
The NFL QB dashboard was created in the mix of week 12 of the NFL season as a MVP Qb Analysis sort of project
It was too analyze the contents of Qb play to nfl contract, to Team Success
(As being a huge Eagles fan I was a fan of Jalen Hurts)
The data found was quite suprsingly

Out of 32 quaterbacks,the most expensive QB in the league is not the most successful one (Aaron Rodgers)
For the most successful bang for buck quaterback for cheap, 2nd year player Brock Purdy was the best option
And for the team with the most guareented success probability on price, stats and team wins
It happened to be Jalen Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles with the best record with the best amount of stats
Not to mention defensive numbers or strength of schedule because the goal is just to win
Now this is very early and things can change
Any * next to a quaterbacks name means that they have been injured or out for the season so please take some stats and team records with a grain of salt.
If anyone was to add or modify to keep the weeks updated during the 2023 season plz go ahead. 


ALL STATS, FINANCIAL NUMBERS WERE SHOWCASED FROM NFL.COM, BLEACHER REPORT AND PRO FOOTBALL FOCUS FOR REFRENCES.
ALL STATS names and jerseys all belong to the database of the NFL.
Just a huge fan and all other fans are awesome to
Go Birds and Go other fans of the NFL. Hope to see you in the Super Bowl.
